# Video Game Sales Analysis and Forecasting

**Objective:** To conduct a comprehensive analysis of video game sales data for Ice, an online, worldwide video game store, to assist stakeholders with predicting the most successful video game releases for the upcoming calendar year.

**Accomplishments:** Based on the data provided, I was able to conclude that at the time the PS4 was, by far, the best selling home platform; that the Nintendo 3DS was, by far, the best selling handheld platform; and that there was virtually no correlation between reviews (from either professional critics or everyday users) and global video game sales. 

I also created profiles for North America, Europe, and Japan that indicate the top 5 best selling video game platforms and genres in each region. 

Lastly, I used two-tailed t-tests (with a 95% confidence interval) to compare user ratings between the Xbox One and PC versions of the same games and also to compare user ratings between Action and Sports games in general.
 
**Skills Demonstrated:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, profile creation, hypothesis testing, and consumer insight generation
